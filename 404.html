  <p><strong>You seem lost.</strong></p>
  <p>It's alright. I'm oftentimes lost too. Lost in thought, in life, at the supermarket, at Ikea. What is life anyways? What's the point of all this stuff? All this doing?</p>
  <p>Maybe the point is to just live, to be. Being lost could be the point. To experience something new and different everyday. Something You don't expect. Even the most unremarkable places can become interesting and beautiful with a little effort. A tilt in perspective. Perhaps you can discover new and exciting things? Or take a look, a little closer, at what's right in front of you. See details you had never noticed before because you were too busy being NOT lost.</p>
