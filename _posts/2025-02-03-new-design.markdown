Hi Friends,

New year, new design. This is my new website for 2025. Hopefully for far beyond this year too.

It's designed more minimialistic than past experiments. I've gotten a lot better with CSS Grid. Which is Over powered. I also have a fun little idea about adding grunge and graffiti to the blog, as if it was some wall somewhere, arbitrarily. Like covering text, and images in silly ways. I think it will be fun. Also it gives me a recurring outlet for small pieces of Art. Like for fun. Just hacking away on my website when I'm bored, vandalizing it.

I'm gonna vandalize this web page.
