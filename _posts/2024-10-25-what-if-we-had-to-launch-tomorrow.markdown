My development style and productivity have greatly improved lately. I now make micro commitments, cut my tasks into much smaller pieces, and have long term focus on things. Part of this philosophy is about estimating my time, but undercutting it by trying to get SOME version complete much sooner. The idea is, you ask yourself a question: "What if we had to launch tomorrow?". Could you?

Usually I approach that question with the answer: that it takes time to make great things, and that's true. But more importantly it takes iteration. It's much easier to tidy up a crooked house, than to build a brand new one. When it comes to development, having something that's small, focused, and works, even if it doesn't do all that it's meant to do yet, is better than trying to build the whole thing at once. 

Once you have, more than a foundation, a V1. A popsicle stand instead of a skyscraper, you can build onto the little popsicle stand. Replace the doors, fix the lights, expand the kitchen, etc... etc.... There is opportunity to improve what you have and iterate, when you have something that works to iterate on.

This can be applied to design work as well. It's much easier to redesign, than to design from scratch. Iteration is the key improvement. Truly you can't make great things, unless you have a lot of practice at making things. Making the same thing over and over, quickly, will get you that experience to do it right.

# Pomodoro
I like it. It's this thing, where you have a timer, and you focus on one thing for 25 minutes, and then you take a break for 5 minutes. I've been using this app, [Session](https://stayinsession.com) for a while now to track my time and try to stay focused. I usually just ignore the timer and keep going. But it wasn't until.
