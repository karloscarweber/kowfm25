I've got more to lose than most when a guy comes into power that promises to deport my wife, my extended family, and most of my friends, and my kid's friends'.

America has shifted to be more Fascist, Racist, and Misogynistic than I hoped. I was hoping for not that.

I'm not depressed. Or Sad. A little Angry maybe.

Being led by the mediocre is the price of Apathy.

Building a better world means fucking building it. Doing the work, whatever that is. And taking others along the way with you. That's what I plan on doing.
