Kona is my effort to write a fucking sick ass programming language to replace javascript, Which I hate. Absolutely hate that thing. Hate can take you far my friends!

No I'm playin'. I don't like javascript, and Kona is a replacement I'm working on, but it's more than that. I've got some good ideas for this thing. To bootstrap a language and build it you've gotta do some things.
