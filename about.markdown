I'm a *designer/programmer* person. Yeah... one of those.

for 13 years I've been paid real American buckos to make things on computers. I'm not sure how I keep convincing people to give me their hard earned money... But I can do it. Most of the folks are happy too.

I want to make things that are fun, interesting, and delightful. To spark a sense of wonder and happiness. Technology is often, incorrectly, used as a crutch to solve problems that are people problems. Tech should be simple, reliable, and unobtrusive. Let's keep it simple.

## Where to find me

you can email [me@kow.fm](mailto:me@kow.fm), and I'll respond. I run a little studio thing for digital products, art, design, apps, websites, at [Capsule.graphics](https://capsule.graphics).
